## 👋 About Me

I'm m4m3tx4, a 14-year-old self-taught developer from Algeria 🇩🇿.
From a young age, I found passion in coding, hacking systems, and building tools that solve real problems.
While others play games, I reverse them. While most fear breaking things, I break them to learn.

Despite limited resources and support, I’ve:

🔓 Unlocked bootloaders on locked-down devices like the OPPO A12

📱 Rooted systems most said were impossible to touch

🛠️ Started building my own tools for PC & Android users

🐍 Mastered Python before even finishing high school

🎯 My dream?
To study and work at Ubisoft Canada, building the future of gaming and AI — and to prove that no dream is too big, no age too small.

"I don't just want to be a developer… I want to be a revolution in tech."
